# Student-Teacher Anomaly Detection Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of a student-teacher anomaly detection model using PyTorch. The model is designed to identify anomalies in data by leveraging the knowledge distillation technique, where a "teacher" model guides a "student" model to learn normal patterns in the data.
